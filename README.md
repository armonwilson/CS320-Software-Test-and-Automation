# CS320-Software-Test-and-Automation

CS320 Final Project
This repository contains artifacts from my software testing and quality assurance coursework, showcasing my skills in unit testing, test design, and code analysis.

## Project One: Contact Service

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- **Create unit tests:** I developed comprehensive JUnit tests for the `Contact` and `ContactService` classes to ensure code functionality and identify potential errors.
- **Analyze testing approaches:** I evaluated different testing strategies based on the requirements and selected the most appropriate approach for unit testing the contact service.
- **Apply testing strategies:** I implemented unit tests covering various scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs, boundary conditions, and exception handling.

## Project Two: Summary and Reflections Report

This report provides a detailed analysis of my testing approach, experiences, and reflections from Project One. It highlights my understanding of software testing techniques, quality assurance principles, and the importance of a disciplined mindset.

## Reflections

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

Ensuring code functionality and security requires a multi-faceted approach. Firstly, comprehensive testing, including unit, integration, and system testing, is crucial to identify and address potential errors and vulnerabilities. Secondly, adhering to secure coding practices, such as input validation and output encoding, helps prevent common security risks. Regular code reviews and static analysis tools can further enhance code quality and security.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

Understanding user needs is fundamental to software development. This involves gathering requirements through user interviews, surveys, and feedback analysis. Translating these needs into program features requires careful design and implementation, ensuring the software is user-friendly, efficient, and meets the intended purpose.

**How do I approach designing software?**

My approach to software design starts with a thorough understanding of the problem and user requirements. I then break down the problem into smaller, manageable modules and design the system architecture. I prioritize modularity, maintainability, and scalability in my design, using design patterns and best practices to ensure a robust and efficient solution.
